They get revenge from Sao Paulo

Sorry geng but ur fluke run ends here
T1 should have been here tbf
T1 couldn't even get a map off of PRX , what are you wafflin bruv 😭?
it should have been TS, but they lost a clutch on OT against gen g..........................................
Gen g should be here lol 
LOUD 2-1 GEN
t3xture drops 100 bomb over 3 maps
he will drop less than 30
LESSSSSSSSSSSS UMA MÁQUINA
LOUD 2-0 GenG because on a BO3 Loud is pretty good
Loud 1-2 geng
The map pool from what I've seen watching these two teams favors geng
GenG 2-0
Might be one of gengs worst matchups I'm afraid.
But hey 2023 geng almost beat loud 2024 still has hope
Almost beat loud?
I mean 28-22 seems pretty close to me
Nah geng got this the map pool favour them imo
Loud 2x0 
Banger, LOCK-IN rematch
GEN 2-0 LOUD
loud vulnerable to counterstrat imo and geng been looking good.
hot take
GENG 2-0 LOUD
vulnerable as any other composition. It’s hard to imagine loud not fixing the highlighted gaps on their comps.
BANGERRRRRR
this will be good
GenG beat PRX just to face LOUD 💀💀💀
Better to face LOUD than EDG. If EG can take a map away, I am sure that Gen.G can get one as well, maybe even two.
i have faith in geng but its just sad for them to face the toughest seed 2 opponent
GEN.G 2-1 LOUD
asian teams are LOUD’s kryptonite
karon > tuyz
t3xture> qck
lakia< cauanzin
munchkin> saadhak (mechanics)
meteor<Less
no way you think munchkin is better than saadhak mechanically
bro watched 0 GEN.G games
You realise when 2023 t1 boot camped in America some people they scrimmed with thought munchkin was hacking because his aim was so good 
i know munchkin is insane i have seen him play but saadhak aint fns too he is even with munchkin at least
we talkin about the same saadhak?
muchkin is dogshit r we talking abt same muchkin
LOUD 2-1 GEN
LOUD 2-1 GEN.G
GEN.G 2-1 LOUD
LOUD 2x1 GENG
Loud 2-1 GenG
GenG 2 - 0 Loud easy, saadhak bottom frag as always
did we get lucky, familia?
sei nao, esse textura ai é o demonio
Se for as mesmas comps de sempre, breach, Viper e Phoenix, talvez seja mais difícil doq deveria, mas acho que a Loud passa
LOUD Less Drops 100
GENG 2 - 1 Loud
GENG 2-1 t3xture drops 70
Chovy 2-1 LOUD
Very close match but remember to never doubt saadhak
GENG 2-1
If GenG made their homework, they should win 2-1.  After seeing Loud Icebox vs EG, I developed PSTD. If GenG didn't do their homework, probably we'll be seeing Loud winning 2-0 with possibilty of any map being a 13-1 or 13-3... and knife kills 
LLL 2-1 GEN
loud 2-0
Loud 2-1 Gen
Close game lets go loud
Geng 2-1
Ge gets more hate
Less drops 40 one map
gg to gg
GenG 2-1
good match
ngl a hard match for either team but I think loud still has some advantage over Geng
I don’t see LOUD losing this even though geng can match them firepower wise ngl
Probably will just be a calling diff
GENG will choke like their league team on int event
Less vs Karon
